# Project Reflection 

## What did you build?
I built a space runner game in Python in which you are trying to get the highest score possible, while getting hunted down by monsters. There are space visuals in the background, powerups to pickup along the way, and a combo meter. 

## What language(s) or tools did you use?
I built this fully in Python, but installed PyGame for the game-look. I imported the Math module, the Random module, and PyGame. 

## What AI tools did you use, and how?
I used a combination of Cursor and ClaudeAI. ClaudeAI was mainly used to gain an idea of what type of games I would be able to make, and the bulk of the debugging was also done on ClaudeAI. Cursor was used for the main coding portion, but some of the outputs were unpredictable so I had to go manually change it. 

## What did you do versus what AI helped with?
I provided the idea to AI, and guided it in the right direction to give me the desired output I want. Sometimes, the desired outcome is no where near what I wanted, so I have to manually find the issue, understand a portion of the code, and debug it by hand. AI helped with bringing the idea to life, providing useful insights on what I could improve on and changing those improvements. 

## What's one thing your proud of?
One thing I am very proud of is the shooting star effect in the background of my game. The Math portion of this was really messed up, and so I had to manually go in there and fix up the randomness of the shooting stars.

## What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
I would improve the quality of the monsters in my game. They look like blocks with eyes right now, but with more time I would make them interactive, more scary looking, and increased functionality.
